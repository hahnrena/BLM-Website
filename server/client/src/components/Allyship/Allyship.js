                        Don’t call the cops. You may need to think more about this one, 
                        especially if your first reaction is "but they keep us safe!" There's tons of research on why the police don't actually keep us safe. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Unearth your internalized anti-blackness. Reflect on how anti-blackness shows up in your  life – we  often miss our own biases.
                            Be intentional about finding these blindspots. This can show up  more when feeling panic, fear, anger, etc. 
                            leading to actions like calling the police.

                        Challenge the model minority myth. When asians are characterized as polite and law-abiding citizens with a higher level of success than other people of color, 
                        it's used as a racial hierarchy to perpetuate anti-blackness.
